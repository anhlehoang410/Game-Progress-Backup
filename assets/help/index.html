<!--  h1>Game Progress Backup Help</h1-->

<p><b><i>So, you want to backup your application without root!</i></b></p>
<br/>
<p><b><i>It's a little hard, but now you can do it!</i></b></p></h2>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This application is experimental, so if you use it you could experiment problems or damages; use it at your own risk: I disclaim all liability for damages or problems caused from it.</p>

<h2>Before we begin</h2>
<p>Not all game progresses can be saved without having root privileges, so if you want to backup everything you have to root your device. Game support will grow, be patient!<br/><p>

<h2>Why backup?</h2>
<p>I can think about two good reasons to do a backup: to not lose your progress and to move your progress to a different device and continue playing.</p>

<h2>Why don't root?</h2>
<p>Root gives to you complete power on your phone (from which "comes great responsibility" - thank you Stan Lee), but you will lose warranty, so you could think twice rooting it if you are not an advanced user.</p>

<h2>Backup</h2>
<p>To backup progresses of a supported game you have to choose it from the list and click on it. It will appear a menu from which you'll have to select "Backup to SD CARD". Files will be saved in "/sdcard/game_progress_backup/.</p>

<h2>Restore</h2>
<p>To restore an existing backup you have to:</p>
<p>1) Run the game and begin playing so that the game will create for you the files you need (you can do it yourself, because you haven't got root permissions)</p>
<p>2) choose the game from the list and click on it. It will appear a menu from which you'll have to select "Restore from SD CARD".</p>

<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>Scripts are intended to run a task. To use a script you have to select "Scripts" tab and select it from the list. Clicking on a script will show his description. To run a script, click on it and select "Run" under the description.</p>
